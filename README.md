### Problem Statement
The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a
specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. Data is in raw form (not
scaled).The data has 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output
variable, and 1030 instances (observations).

### Context
Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete
compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients.
These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water,
superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.

##### 
### Steps performed 
1) Training a model to predict concrete compressive strength
2) Deploying it on Heroku
